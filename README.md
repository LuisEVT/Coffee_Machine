# Coffee_Machine

In this project, I wrote a program that simulates a coffee machine that makes three different types of drinks: Expresso, Latte, and Cappuccino. The user is introduced to a menu option that will determine if user wants to buy a drink, fill coffee machine with the incredients, take the money collected, see how much incredients and money is in the machine, and lastly exit the program. 

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
* remaining

- The coffee machine has:
- 400 ml of water
- 540 ml of milk
- 120 g of coffee beans
- 9 disposable cups
- $550 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
* buy

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
* 2
* I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit):
* exit
